In this section we will present some properties of the eigenfunctions of the previously defined laplacian operator.
The laplacian eigenfunction are the solution of the variational problem for an action called \ii{Dirichlet energy}, as shown in \cite{bronstein}.

\begin{defn}
    Let $f:M\to\R$ be a sufficiently regular funcion, we define the \ii{Dirichlet energy functional} to be
    \[ D[f] := \int_{M} dx |\nabla f(x)|^2 = \int_{M} dx f(x)\Delta f(x) .\]
    {\color{red} La seconda uguaglianza è vera solo se f si annulla sul bordo.}
\end{defn}

The variational problem for the Dirichlet energy leads to the Euler-Lagrange equations when it is restricted to those functions which
vanish on the boundary of the domain of integration. In order to solve the variational problem subject to constraints we need a variational 
version of the Lagrange multipliers theorem, a proof of which can be found in \cite{fomin}.

\begin{prop}
    Let $f \in L^2(M)$ the variational problem minimizing the Dirichlet energy functional $\int_M dx (gradf)^2$, 
    admit as solution the kernel of the laplacian. Otherwise if we wish to have normalized functions only
    to avoid uniformly vanishing functions i.e. $\int_M dx f^2 = 1$ we get as solution the eigenfunction of the laplacian
    relative to its lowest eigenvalue. After this the same process can be applied to graphs.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} \hfill \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
	$\int f \Delta f = \int (gradf)^2$, the problem $\delta \int (gradf)^2 = 0$ is solved with the
	Euler-Lagrange equations $div \pder{\mc{L}}{(gradf)}=\pder{\mc{L}}{f}$, which give $\Delta f = 0$.
	\item
	This time we have $\delta[\int (gradf)^2 - \lambda (\int f^2 -1)]=0$, which using the same equations
	leads to $\Delta f = \lambda f$, and since for those functions $\int f \Delta f = \lambda$, we want to find
	the minumum eigenvalue of the laplacian.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
    \underline{Discrete optimization problems related to the laplacian}\\
    Let $\phi$ be an $k \times k$ matrix, the variational problem minimizing the Dirichlet energy $Tr(\phi^T \Delta \phi)$ is equivalent to
    the problem $\Delta \phi = 0$, while if we normalize the functions we get $\Delta \phi = \Lambda \phi$, where $\Lambda = diag(\lambda)$ with 
    the k lowest eigenvalues.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} \hfill \\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
	Let $min_{\phi}Tr(\phi^T \Delta \phi) = \phi_{li}\Delta_{lk}\phi_{ki} = \sum_i \phi_i^T \Delta \phi_i $ (Einstein notation) be our optimization problem,
	since $\Delta > 0$ we can simply solve for all $\phi_i$ and minimize $\pder{\mc{L}_i}{\phi_j} = \pder{\phi_i^T \Delta \phi_i}{\phi_j}
	 = 2\Delta\phi_i=0$.
	 \item
	Let $min_{\phi}Tr(\phi^T \Delta \phi) = \phi_{li}\Delta_{lk}\phi_{ki} = \sum_i \phi_i^T \Delta \phi_i $ (Einstein notation) be our optimization problem,
        under the constraint $\phi^T \phi = I$(orthonormal) since $\Delta > 0$ we can simply solve for all $\phi_i$ and minimize 
	$\pder{\mc{L}_i}{\phi_j} = \pder{(\phi_i^T \Delta \phi_i -\lambda_i(\phi_i^T\phi_i -1))}{\phi_j}$(non sostituisco l'1 perché non posso sostituire il vincolo 
	nel vincolo)$ = 2\Delta\phi_i-2\lambda_i\phi_i=0$. And since the initial trace is equal to the sum of our k positive eigenvalues we shall take the
	k lowest eigenvalues. The problem can be shown to be $\Delta \phi = \Lambda \phi$.
   \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
    \underline{Continuous spectrum of the laplacian in $\R^3$}\\
    Let $f \in L^2(\Omega)$, in particular in a Schwartz space where the Fourier Transform is invertible and selfadjoint,
    then we have that $\Delta \phi_p = p^2 \phi_p$, where $\forall f \in L^2$ we can write $f = \int_\Omega dp c_p \phi_p$
    and $\int_\Omega dx \phi_p \phi_{p'} = \delta(p-p')$, that is generalized Hilbert Base up to normalization.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} \hfill  \\
    So if the Fourier transform is invertible we have that $f(x') = \int_\Omega dp e^{i\scal{x'}{p}}\int_\Omega dx e^{-i\scal{x}{p}}f(x)$, 
    then by the definition of the shift functional we can represent it with its integral kernel $\int_\Omega dp e^{i\scal{x'-x}{p}}$, which
    is equal to $\delta(x-x') = \delta(x'-x)$. Trivially we have that our laplacian eigenfunctions are $\phi_p = e^{i\scal{x}{p}}$ of eigenvalue $p^2$, since 
    $f(x) = \mc{F}^\dag \mc{F}f = \int_\Omega dp (\mc{F}f)(p)e^{i\scal{x}{p}}$ we define our coefficients $c_p$. We just have to show that
    $\int dx e^{i\scal{x}{p'-p}} = \delta(p'-p)$ that is true by definition.\\
