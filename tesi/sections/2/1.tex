    The goal of machine learning is teaching machines to approximate expert observers.
    Thinking of the space of possible machines as possibly convex and compact, we can say that we are able to define every possible machine
    via a finite number of parameters and that by varying those parameters we can be able to find a unique best approximation of this observer.
    In a world where technology leads and science can hardly keep up with the new technological discoveries, we are sad to claim that a clear mathematical
    explanation of the reason why such deep learning architectures are so successful is missing.
