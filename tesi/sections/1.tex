    Before discussing deep learning on graphs and manifolds we will give a definition of
    graph and higher dimensional structures called abstract simplicial complexes, in order 
    to define convolutions on those structures we will define the Laplace operator by 
    translating De Rham cohomology on oriented simplicial complexes.
    Furthermore we shall discuss other possible definitions of convolution based on the invariance of 
    oriented simplicial complexes under some group of transformations i.e. even permutations
    of indexes.
