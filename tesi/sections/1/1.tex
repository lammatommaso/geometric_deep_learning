    The essential idea in algebraic topology is to convert problems about topological spaces and continuous functions into
    problems about algebraic objects and their homomorphisms, this way one hopes to end up with an easier problem to solve. 
    The language of category theory, the discussion of which can be found in \cite{rotman}, shall be our main tool to formally
    describe this conversion process, i.e. via functors. Functors are a formal way to transpose equivalences from one world to another, 
    if for instance two objects in the world A are A-equal and one can define a functor to the world B, then the images of those two objects 
    must be B-equal in the world B and this implication is strictly directed. Usually, though, one moves to the world B because he has no idea
    whether the two objects in A are equal or not, therefore from a knowledge of the B-equivalence classes in B, one can use the contrapositive implication 
    to understand if the objects in A are not equal.\\
    \hfill \\
    First of all we shall introduce algebraic objects called simplicial complexes and see how they are related to compact
    topological spaces. In order to do that we require the definitions of convex envelopes and affine independence of points in $\R^n$.

    \begin{defn}
        Let $I$ be a finite set of indexes, we define the \ii{convex envelope} of the points $\{x_i\}_{i \in I} \subset \R^n$ to be 
        \[ [ x_i ]_{i \in I} := \{ \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i x_i : \lambda_i \in \R,\ \lambda_i \geq 0,\  \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i = 1 \}.\]
    \end{defn}

    It is easy to see that compact envelopes are convex and compact sets with respect to the standard topology in $\R^n$.
    From now, if not otherwise specified, we shall assume $I$ to be a finite set of indexes.

    \begin{prop}
        Let $\{x_i\}_{i \in I} \subset \R^n$ then $[ x_i ]_{i \in I}$ is the smallest convex set containing $X$.
    \end{prop}

    The order by which we define the smallest convex set is the one give by the relation $\subseteq$.

    \begin{defn}
        Let $\{x_i\}_{i \in I} \subset \R^n$ we define the points $\{x_i\}_{i \in I}$ to be \ii{affinely independent} if and only if
        \[ \sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i x_i = \sum_{i \in I} \mu_i x_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
        \lambda_i = \mu_i \; \forall i \in I ,\]
        whenever $\sum_{i \in I} \lambda_i = \sum_{i \in I} \mu_i = 1$.
    \end{defn}

    \begin{exa}
        Let ${A,B,C,D} \subset \R^n$ representing the four vertxes of a square and let $A,D$ be opposite vertxes, one can easily see that 
        \[ D = A + (B-A) + (C-A) = (-1)A + (1)B + (1)C + (0)D = (0)A + (0)B + (0)C + (1)D \, ,\]
        therefore $A,B,C,D$ are not affinely independent.
    \end{exa}

    \begin{defn}
        We define a \ii{p-simplex} to be a convex envelop $[ x_i ]_{i \in I}$
        where $\{x_i\}_{i \in I} \subset \R^n$ are affinely independent and $|I| = p + 1$.
    \end{defn}
    
    One denotes the vertex set $\{ x_i \}_{i \in I}$ of a simplex $\sigma = [ x_i ]_{i \in I}$ by $Vert(\sigma)$.
    
    \begin{defn}
        Let $\sigma$ be a p-simplex, we say that another t-simplex $\tau$ is a \ii{face} of $\sigma$ or equivalently 
        that $\sigma$ is a \ii{coface} of $\tau$, by our notiation $\tau \leq \sigma$, if and only if $\tau \subset \sigma$, where $t \leq p$.
    \end{defn}

    \begin{defn}
        We define a \ii{simplicial complex} $\mc{G}$ to be a collection of simplexes such that
        \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
            \item $ \tau \leq \sigma \in \mc{G} \Rightarrow \tau \in \mc{G}$ (inheritance property),
            \item $ \sigma, \tau \in \mc{G} \Rightarrow \sigma \cap \tau \in \mc{G}$ (intersection property).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{defn}

    \begin{defn}
        Let $\mc{G},\mc{H}$ be simplicial complexes, then a \ii{simplicial map} $\phi : \mc{G} \to \mc{H}$ is a function 
        such that whenever $[ x_i ]_{i \in I} \in \mc{G}$, then $\phi([ x_i ]_{i \in I}) = [ \phi(v_i) ]_{i \in I} \in \mc{H}$,
        where $\phi(x_i) \in Vert(\mc{H}) \, \forall i \in I$.
    \end{defn}

    \begin{thm}[ $\bb{G}$ is a category]
    \end{thm}

    \begin{defn}
        Let $\mc{G}$ be a simplicial complex, we define its \ii{underlying space} $|\mc{G}| = \bigcup_{\sigma in \mc{G}} \sigma$, provided with
        the standard topology inherited from $\R^n$.
    \end{defn}

    Since the union of compact sets is compact the underlying space of a simplicial complex in $\R^n$ is a compact topological subspace of $\R^n$.

    \begin{defn}
        A topological space $X$ is called \ii{polyhedron} if there exists a simplicial complex $\mc{G}$ and a homeomorphism
        $h : |\mc{G}| \to X$. The ordered pair $(\mc{G}, h)$ is called a \ii{triangulation} of $X$.
    \end{defn}

    One understands that in order to have a homeomorphism between the compact underlying space of a simplcial complex and another topological
    space, this other space has to be compact too.

    \begin{lem}[gluing lemma, Rotman]
    \end{lem}

    \begin{defn}[Piecewise linear map]
    \end{defn}

    \begin{thm}[ | | : \bb{G} $\to$ \bb{Top} is a functor]
    \end{thm}

    (The directionality of this functor gives a direction to implications reguarding identities)

    Although this approach provides simplicial complexes with the topology inherited from the metric space it hides the power of simplicial complexes 
    to describe those networks and interactions which would happily exist without that topology, to make this distinction clear enough we will treat
    simplicial complexes as a realization of more abstract objects called abstract simplicial complexes \cite{rotman}.
    
    \begin{defn}
        Let $\mc{V}$ be a finite set we define an \ii{abstract simplicial complex} $\mc{A}$ to be 
        \[\mc{A}:=\{ \sigma  \subset \mc{V} : \tau \subset \sigma \Rightarrow \tau \in \mc{A} \}\] 
        where $\sigma$ are called \ii{abstract simplexes} of $\mc{A}$.
    \end{defn}
    
    One calls $\mc{V}$ the \ii{vertex set} of $\mc{A}$ and denotes it by $Vert(\mc{A})$; since the vertex
    set is finite we expect every abstract simplex to be also finite, therefore we might use the notation $\sigma = \{ v_i \}_{i \in I_\sigma}$,
    which so far we consider invariant under arbitrary permutations of the finite index set $I_\sigma$.

    \begin{defn}
        Let $\mc{A}$ be an abstract simplicial complex we define its \ii{dimension} to be
        \[ dim \mc{A} := max_{\sigma \in \mc{A}}(|\sigma|-1), \]
        where by $|\sigma|$ we denote the cardinality of $\sigma$.
    \end{defn}

    One calls an abstract simplex of dimension $p$ an \ii{abstract p-simplex}, according to our
    definition the empy set is a $(-1)$-simplex. A \ii{graph} is a one dimensional abstract simplicial complex.

    \begin{defn}
        Let $\mc{A},\mc{B}$ be abstract simplicial complexes, then a \ii{simplicial map} $\phi : \mc{A} \to \mc{B}$ is a function 
        such that whenever $\sigma = \{v_i\}_{i \in I_\sigma} \in \mc{A}$, then $\phi(\{v_i\}_{i \in I_\sigma}) = \{\phi(v_i)\}_{i \in I_\sigma} \in \mc{B}$,
        where $\phi(v_i) \in Vert(\mc{B}) \, \forall i \in I_\sigma$.
    \end{defn}

    Although the vertex to vertex mapping is a quite selective condition on the function we did not prevent it from cramming
    abstract simplexes into lower dimensional ones.

    \begin{thm}
        All abstract simplicial complexes and simplicial maps are a category $\bb{A}$ whose identities are called isomorphisms.
    \end{thm}

    Although abstract simplicial complex can be used to model any kind of vertex interaction they lack of a topology, we wish
    therefore to define some structures in a euclidean space that can be related unequivocally(i.e. via a functor) to abstract simplicial complexes.
    We shall call those geometric simplicial complexes to avoid misunderstandings.

    \begin{defn}
        \ii{Geometric realization of an abstract simplicial complex}\\
        Let $\mc{K}$ be a geometric simplicial complex, and let $Vert(\mc{K}) := \{\sigma \in \mc{K} : dim(\sigma) = 0\}$, we call
        the abstract simplicial complex $\mc{A} := \{ \{x_i\}_{i \in I} \subset Vert(\mc{K}) : \langle x_i \rangle_{i \in I} \in \mc{K} \}$
        a vertex scheme for $\mc{K}$ or equivalently we might say that $\mc{K}$ is a geometric realization of $\mc{A}$.
    \end{defn}
    \begin{thm}
        Let $\mc{A}$ be a d-dimentional abstract simplicial complex, it admits a geometric realization in $\R^{2d+1}$.
    \end{thm}
    Kuratowski theorem proves the prevuois statement to be also sharp.
