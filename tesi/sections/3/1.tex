    Convolutional neural networks or CNN's are today one of the most common deep learing architectures, especially successful at classifying images.
    Image classifiction is not the only task they can be used for, rather an intuitive task that we will use to introduce CNN's.

    The input of a CNN is data defined on some domain, in the case of image recognition it is a grid sampling a compact subset of $\R^2$.
    The convolutional layers are a collection of convolutional operators and non linearities defined by parameters that are learned during the training
    of the network. The output in this case is an abstract representation of the input that can be then classified.

    Every classifying task has an intrinsic invariance. For instance classification of an image should be shift-invariant, since shifting the objects in the
    image shouldn't affect their classification and identity.
