    Another approach that can be used to define a convolution is defining spectral convolution with respect to a laplacian operator, in this section
    we will see this abstract and general method on graphs.

    {\color{blue}

    To understand why the laplacian operator plays such an important role in convolution we will review the laplacian eigenfunctions in one dimension.
    Let's consider the space of complex-valued functions defined on the real line. We cannot find an orthonormal basis for this space out of laplacian
    eigenfunctions, nevertheless we can find an generalized orthonormal basis.

    The basis we are looking for is $\phi_k(x) = C e^{ikx}$ where $k \in \R$ is a parameter that can be used to label the eigenfunctions
    and $C \in \C$ is fixed by the conditions in app. \ref{app:B}.
    The position operator $x$ is defined by the spactral relation $\cc{x}x = x\cc{x}$, where $x \in \R$ on the right side is the eigenvalue of the position operator
    on $\ch{x}$. When defining the position operator we also require $\{ \ch{x} : x \in \R\}$ to be a generalized orthonormal basis.
    Using the Dirac notation $\braket{x}{k} = \phi_k(x)$, and since it is a generalized orthonormal basis we also have that
    $\int_\R dk \ch{k}\cc{k} = 1$ and $\braket{m}{k} = \delta(m-k)$ if $\ch{m}$ is also an eigenfunction of the laplacian.
    We shall not prove here that this is an orthonormal generalized basis for our space.

    In order to construct a convolutional neural network that classifies data defined on a graph we need a definition of convolution on graphs.
    Here we want to define a convolution on graphs based on this fact. First we introduce what we call \ii{graph Fourier transform}.
    
    \begin{defn}
        Let $\ket{f} \in C_0$ and $dimC_0 = n_0$, we define the \ii{graph Fourier transform}\\
        $\mc{F}_0 : \R^{n_0} \to \R^{n_0}$ to be
        \[ (\braket{i}{f})_{i \in I} \mapsto (\braket{e_i}{f})_{i \in I},\]
        where $I = \{1,...,n_0\}$ and $\ch{e_i}$ are the eigenfunctions of the $0$-laplacian.
    \end{defn}

    This transform only defines a change of basis since $\ket{f} = \sum_{i \in I}\braket{i}{f}\ket{i} = \sum_{i \in I}\braket{e_i}{f}\ket{e_i}$, and therefore is invertible.
    We can in fact represent the graph Fourier transform with the matrix $F^{-1}_{ij} = F^\dagger_{ij} := \braket{e_i}{j}$, and its inverse $F_{ij} := \braket{i}{e_j}$.
    To define a convolution between two $0$-chains we use the famous convolution theorem $\mc{F}(f * \psi) = \mc{F}(f)\mc{F}(\psi)$. 

    \begin{defn}
        Let $\{\ket{e_i}\}_{i \in I}$ be a basis such that $\Delta_p\ket{e_i} = \lambda_i\ket{e_i}$, let $\ket{f},\ket{\psi} \in C_p$, we define the representatives of $\ket{f * \psi}$ on
        the laplacian eigenchains to be 
        \[ \braket{e_i}{f * \psi} := \braket{e_i}{f}\braket{e_i}{\psi} \quad \forall i \in I.\]
        Therefore $\ket{f * \psi} = \sum_{i \in I}\braket{e_i}{f}\braket{e_i}{\psi}\ket{e_i}$.
    \end{defn}

    This can be trivially extended to simplicial complexes \footnote{Actually on any chain complex.} using the eigenfunctions of higher dimensional laplacians, as done in \cite{simplicialNN}.
